          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Network Media explores the creative, technical, and critical tools to realize web-based projects. Workshops on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are framed by cultural discourses examining the Internet. Conceived for artists, designers, and technologists, the course is focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the technical concepts in web design while learning the history of the Internet as well as its social, political, and philosophical implications.</p>

          Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
            <ul>
              <li>Project 1 10%</li>
              <li>Project 2 10%</li>
              <li>Project 3 10%</li>

              <li>Final project documentation 10%</li>
              <li>Participation 20%</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, and sufficient work that does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs.</p>
          
          <h4 class='sr-only'>Projects</h4>
          <p><span class='label'><a onclick='openSection("#projects")'>Projects.</a></span> Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned via the <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AQwFrb3uppWnosvbMqKJP3Xg8ykHO7Yc8Uw1UNgt21Y/edit#gid=1891355314' target='_blank'>project spreadsheet</a>. Projects may be turned in up to one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save issues, editor or browser errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly click File > Download to save a copies of your work in progress as zip files. It would also be wise to make a backup of these online or on an external harddrive or USB stick in case your computer is lost.</p>

          <h4 class='sr-only'>Reading Discussions</h4>
          <p><span class='label'>Reading Discussions.</span> TODO</p>

          
          <h4 class='sr-only'>Participation</h4>
          <p><span class='label'>Participation.</span> Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for meetings, offer feedback during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If there are concerns please let me or Hye Min know as soon as possible.</p>
          
          <h4 class='sr-only'>Attendance</h4>
          <p><span class='label'><a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EWgywcX2UXznQcioXS0Sy0VbtaC8toW9EXIQCYwAXjc/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>Attendance.</a></span> You get one unexcused absence, no questions asked. Each unexcused absence after that will result in one full letter grade deduction. Three unexcused absences will result in a failed grade in the class. If there is an emergency and you must miss class, email <a href='mailto:hyeminchocho@gmail.com'>Hye Min</a> before class. Absences will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you will be marked tardy. Three tardies results in one unexcused absence. Your attendance can be viewed <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EWgywcX2UXznQcioXS0Sy0VbtaC8toW9EXIQCYwAXjc/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>here</a>, any disputes should be discussed with the TA within two weeks.</p>

          <h3>Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</h3>
          <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.

          <h3>Disability Services</h3>
          <p>UCLA strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on a disability, please let me know as soon as possible. It is necessary for you to register with the <a href='http://www.cae.ucla.edu/'>UCLA Center for Accessible Education</a> so that we can establish reasonable accommodations. After registration, make arrangements with me to discuss how to implement these accommodations.</p>

            <p>By 1/16: Write or select a short text (one paragraph or less) that you will read/perform for the class. By 1/23: Based on the text, design and build a virtual mask that you will use to perform the text. Using the <a href='https://editor.p5js.org/lmccart/sketches/rJ3KhWVzV'>provided code template</a>, make your mask react to audio, changing as the volume of your voice changes. This project will be evaluated based on how the face relates to the text, the variation of the mask (how much is changes), the design of the mask, and your performance of it.</p>

            <p>Turn your project in via the <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_mDmytGBObsx07kMbLsd47jKx_G5flzT9ZbalEAykWQ/edit'>project spreadsheet</a> by 9am on 1/23. Include the text to be performed as a comment at the top of the code. You will perform your mask in class on 1/23. Rehearse your text performance ahead of time, modulating the volume of your voice as needed to control the mask.</p>

            <h4>Description</h4>

            <p>There's a long history of writing software to draw on computers. From the light pen, to the mouse, to touch screens, some of these programs are basic and some are bursting with features; some are serious and others are whimsical; some are general and others are as unique as the individual who wrote them. This project has three parts. You will make a separate sketch for each part of the project, the canvas for each sketch should be 600 x 600 pixels.</p>

            <p>PART A (2 points)<br>
              Use the mouseX, mouseY, and mouseIsPressed variables in a program to make the simplest drawing program you can imagine, but with a slight twist.</p>

            <p>PART B (2 points)<br>
              Start with your code from Part A and add the keyPressed() event function to clear the screen with a different color when each of the keys 1-5 is pressed. Select your colors thoughtfully and carefully.</p>

            <p>PART C (6 points)<br>
              Write a drawing program in the tradition of <a href='https://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/' target='_blank'>Kid Pix</a>. Include, at the minimum, at least two different tools for making marks and two other features. Create an interface to select which tool to draw with, by creating buttons and/or by using the keyboard. Have a clear point of view about drawing that is expressed through the design of your program. How is your drawing program unique and what is it for? Write a detailed comment at the top of the code that explains the core idea of the software.</p>

            <p>Attend the Astra Taylor "What is Democracy?" film screening on 2/12, or her talk on 2/19. Both are at 6pm in the EDA.</p>
            
            <p>Take screencaptures or photos of at least 5-10 pieces of media you come across that's intended to influence you. Use this media to create an interactive collage that takes on new meaning. You might photoshop or edit the images prior to loading, or digitally manipulate them in code. Consider adding text to recontextualize the images. What role does the interactivity play in shifting meaning?</p>
