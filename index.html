          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Network Media explores the creative, technical, and critical tools to realize Internet-based projects.
            The course is focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the Internet as creative platform—where did
            it come from, how does it work, how do you make things for it, and what do you want to say? Technical
            workshops on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web design support the development of a series of studio projects
            utilizing a variety of network tools. These projects are framed by seminar-style discussions examining
            the cultural, social, political, and philosophical implications of the Internet. We’ll consider the
            roles of race, gender, sexuality, disability, class, and influence within an increasingly networked world,
            and strategies of response as artists and designers.
          </p>

          <h4 class='sr-only'>Projects</h4>
          <p><span class='label'><a onclick='openSection("#projects")'>Projects.</a></span> Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned via the <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AQwFrb3uppWnosvbMqKJP3Xg8ykHO7Yc8Uw1UNgt21Y/edit#gid=1891355314' target='_blank'>project spreadsheet</a>. Projects may be turned in up to one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save issues, editor or browser errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly click File > Download to save a copies of your work in progress as zip files. It would also be smart to make a backup of these online or on an external harddrive or USB stick in case your computer is lost.</p>

          <h4 class='sr-only'>Discussions</h4>
          <p style='margin-bottom:0.75em'><span class='label'><a onclick='openSection("#discussions")'>Discussions.</a></span> We will have seven discussions during the quarter. 
            Each week, you are required to read/watch/listen to at least one of the posted media in advance. 
            In addition, each person will be responsible for leading one 30 minute discussion, along with 1-2 other people. 
            You can sign up for your <a onclick='openSection("#discussions")'>preferred discussion week</a> by emailing <a href='mailto:dma@hiradsab.com'>dma@hiradsab.com</a> with your top three choices. 
            Hirad will assign based on order received. Your group and discussion assignments can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vhzfuyT9gkDC4mWxVdhvzF3FDifo4aAzbHM4cKEMjPo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">in the discussion spreadsheet</a>. We will take the libery of assigning you to a discussion group if you fail to sign up in time.</p>
          For the discussion you lead:
          <ul>
            <li>Consume all posted media.</li>
            <li>Prepare a few slides to focus the discussion (include key points from the posted media and a couple relevant external references or examples that you find and add).</li>
            <li>Prepare a set of questions to guide the discussion.</li>
            <li>Meet with Hirad during office hours in advance of your discussion to review your questions and plan. If you aren’t able to attend his office hours, email him in advance to schedule an alternative time.</li>
          </ul>
         <br>
          
          <h4 class='sr-only'>Participation</h4>
          <p><span class='label'>Participation.</span> Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class.
            Do the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for meetings, offer feedback during critiques.
            This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and taking creative risks.
            This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together.
            Don’t assume. Try to remain open to learning at all times. Help each other in this.
            If there are concerns please let me or Hirad know as soon as possible.</p>

Each unexcused absence after that will result in one full letter grade deduction. Three unexcused absences will result in a failed grade in the class. If there is an emergency and you must miss class, email <a href='mailto:dma@hiradsab.com'>dma@hiradsab.com</a> before class. Absences will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you will be marked tardy. Three tardies results in one unexcused absence.

          <h3>Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</h3>
          <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.

          <h3>Disability Services</h3>
          <p>UCLA strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on a disability, please let me know as soon as possible. It is necessary for you to register with the <a href='http://www.cae.ucla.edu/'>UCLA Center for Accessible Education</a> so that we can establish reasonable accommodations. After registration, make arrangements with me to discuss how to implement these accommodations.</p>

            <p>Create an interactive hypertext narrative that reveals something about yourself or an experience you've had.
            It could be a story about yourself, a journey through a topic you're interested in,
            a mode of navigation that mimics your personality, etc.
            There should be multiple HTML pages, linked together by &lt;a&gt; tags.
            Each page could contain text and/or images. No styling. Limit your focus to story and interaction.</p>

            <p>Create a homepage for a community. It can be for a community that you're involved with, one that you admire, or a fictional community.
            For instance, a site for a colony of robots that lives on the moon, a nonprofit organization of your choice, or a site for a
            UCLA student group that you're a member of or would like to start. You can imagine that this homepage is part of a larger website,
            but the links don't needed to lead anywhere.<br>
            You can write <code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;my link&lt;/a&gt;</code> to make a link that goes nowhere.
            <br><br>
            You can try to recreate layout and interface patterns you've seen online, or be more experimental with your design.
            In any case, your design should be clearly informed by the content it is representing. Just like with print design,
            how can you use web design to communicate an idea, identity, and community?
            <br><br>
            Your design does not need to be responseive, but should work on either a standard laptop monitor or a mobile phone (your choice).
            When you post your project link, also post a screenshot as it looks on your device for reference.
            See <a href="resources/preview">tutorial on device preview</a> to preview your site for mobile.
            You can host the screenshot anywhere you like as long as it's publicly viewable (Dropbox, GDrive, Imgur, Flickr, etc).

            Create an webpage that transforms between two distinct perspectives or identities through the user's interaction with it.
            "Identity" could mean aspects of a personality, political perspectives, moods, cultural backgrounds, or anything else.
            "User interaction" could encompass click, hover, mouseout (leaving element), doubleclick, keypress, window resize, scroll, or anything else.
            Basically, your page should start in one mode, and look very different during or after user interaction.
            It is suggested that you make use of <a href="https://api.jquery.com/category/events/" target="_blank">JQuery events</a> and 
            <a href="https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/" target="_blank">JQuery effects</a>, though not all of these will be applicable.

          <h3 id='p4' class="toggles">Project 4: Crowdsourcing (DUE 11/5)</h3>
          <div id='p4-content' class='toggle' style='display:none;'>
          <p>This project is about crowds. What do you have to say to them? What can you learn from them?
          Working in partners, you will determine one topic or issue you want to address with a crowd.
          You will then determine one question or task to administer to a crowd.
          Once you have collected your results, you will use them to create a collective portrait of the crowd.</p>
          <br>

          <p><b>Step 1:</b> Determine a topic or issue that your team would like to focus on for this project. 
            It could be something in the news, an issue you feel needs more awareness, or anything else. 
            The topic should be specific, and something you can form a point of view around. 
            That is, "cats" or "the color red" are probably not appropriate topics.</p>
          <br>

          <p><b>Step 2:</b> Think of a way to explore your topic with a crowd. Determine a question or task that will you will administer 
            via social media, <a href="https://www.mturk.com/" target="_blank">amazon mechanical turk</a>, interviewing people in a virtual
            world, or some other online mechanism. 
            You will need to collect at least 30 responses.
            <b>By Tuesday 10/29 you should have initiated your question or task to the crowd.</b>
            For example, you might ask each person to:</p>
           
          <ul>
            <li>Answer a question.</li>
            <li>Give you a piece of information.</li>
            <li>Give you a piece of media (image, sound, video, etc).</li>
            <li>React to a prompt or statement.</li>
            <li>Complete a task and send the results or documentation.</li>
            <li>Do a part of a task that is divided up over many people.</li>
            <li>?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Here are some considerations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clarity – How will you communicate the question/task to people? How will you get them to respond?</li>
            <li>Scale – You will need to be able to collect at least 50 results. What channel will you use?</li>
            <li>Output – You will need to be able to display your results in some type of composition online, so consider the form responses will take.</li>
            <li>Privacy – If you require a very personal or identifiable response, let people know their response will be included in a project that may be publicly viewable online.</li>
            <li>Decency – How are you involving other people in your work? Are they able to consent? Are you treating them with respect?</li>
          </ul>

          <div id='p5-content' class='toggle' style='display:none;'>
          <p>This project is about beginning to think about your final project and teaching yourself something new.
            First, think about some possible ideas for your final project. What new skills might you want to learn to complete this?
            For example, are you interested in working with scrolling, hovering, 3D graphics, sound, or something else?</p>
            <br>
          <p>Your goal is to learn and explore a new library, and use it to make a sketch or prototype of something you may
              want to incorporate into your final project.
              Begin by scanning through the documentation. Does it feel within your reach?
              Follow / fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/186wcaUlJ-e9yYk-T1LuSy-1ZC3Rnb7HkCsECSjCnlFQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">project 5 worksheet</a>.
              Turn in your project via the <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AQwFrb3uppWnosvbMqKJP3Xg8ykHO7Yc8Uw1UNgt21Y/edit#gid=1213945371'>projects spreadsheet</a> by 9am on 11/12. 
                If you are linking to a gdoc, make sure that the sharing settings allow anyone with the link to view.</p>
